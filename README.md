# PlatziMovies
This small application shows lists of movies that are trending, as well as those currently in theaters and a video section. The application is developed with <b>MVVM</b> architecture.<br />
Two methods have also been used for service consumption: NSURLSession and Async-Await, so the minimum target is for iOS 13+ devices. <br />

# Used API
The API used was from The Movie DB site. <br />
https://www.themoviedb.org/ <br />

# Cocoapods
No external libraries were used, so it was not necessary to use Cocoapods or any other dependency handler.<br/>
